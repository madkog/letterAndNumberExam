# letterAndNumberExam

Hi,

Here is my coding entry for the two algorithms.

- Part A) Letter counter
- Part b) Next smallest number using the same number series.

As I was not sure how you want it delivered I have give two simple ways of running the code. 

## 1) Running the code via command line:

This assumes you have access to php CLI 

Part A:

`php ExamSolutions.php <string> `

i.e 

php ExamSolutions.php "This is a test sentence."

Part B:

`php ExamSolutions.php <number>`

i.e

`php ExamSolutions.php 1072`
`php ExamSolutions.php 1027`

## 2) Running the code as an online script

https://www.codephponline.com/

Please copy and paste the code into the php code window and press on "execute code".

The result should show underneath the window.

Note: Unfortunalty they do not have a save feature, even when signed in.

Please comment and uncomment and change variables to trigger results.

 `$params = ['This is a test sentence.'];`
 `// params = ['1072'];`
 `// params = ['1027'];`

## 3) I prefer docker 


I have not included a docker for this as it was not part of the original spec. 

If you would like this dockerised please ask.



Please note, I have put all the code into one file due to the scripting nature and ease of review. In a real app this would be bad practise. 

Please notify me if there are any issues.

Regards,

Nicholas Maddalena
